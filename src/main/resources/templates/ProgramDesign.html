        <h3>Program Design</h3>
        <br/><br/>
        <h4>Define the problem to be solved.</h4>

        <p>The first step to designing a program is defining the problem that needs to be solved.
            What type of inputs need to be considered? How to they need to be processed before outputting?
            Creating clear definitions of your goal will simplify the rest of the process, and prevent you
            from straying to far from the purpose of your program.</p>

        <h4>Outline your solution on paper.</h4>

        <p>It can often help to draw out an outline on paper before you begin typing. Creating a diagram showcasing
            what types of calculations or transformations your program will need to do(putting the definitions you
            worked
            on earlier into practice).</p>

        <h4>Develop the outline into an algorithm.</h4>

        <p>Next refine your outline into strict steps, you don't want your program to do more than your goal. There is
            more information
            on algorithms in other posts.</p>


        <h4>Test the algorithm for correctness.</h4>

        <p>Test your algorithms relentlessly. Try as many different types of inputs as you can, you don't want a user to
            come up with
            something you didn't expect and break your program. Are errors accounted for? Will the program break or
            cycle endlessly, prompt a message
            or simply give the wrong results.</p>

        <h4>Document your solution.</h4>

        <p> It is often a good idea to document and comment all your work. In the future you may forget why you did
            something,
            or someone else might be using your code and need to make changes. It also helps you keep a record of all
            your
            progress as a programmer, giving you a library of examples to refer back to alter when working on future
            projects.</p>
